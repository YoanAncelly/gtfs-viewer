# GTFS-RT Viewer Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements and future direction for the GTFS-RT Viewer project.

## Current Status

The project currently supports basic GTFS-RT data processing functionality:
- Reading GTFS-RT protobuf files (Trip Updates, Vehicle Positions, Alerts)
- Basic data analysis and visualization
- CSV export of processed data
- Simple visualization with matplotlib

## Short-term Goals (Q2 2025)

### User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Create a web-based dashboard for data visualization
- [ ] Add interactive maps for vehicle positions
- [ ] Implement real-time data refresh capabilities
- [ ] Create user-friendly filter options for data exploration

### Data Processing Enhancements
- [ ] Optimize data loading and processing for larger datasets
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for faster repeated analysis
- [ ] Add support for incremental updates
- [ ] Enhance error handling and reporting

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add detailed installation and setup guides
- [ ] Provide examples for common use cases
- [ ] Document data models and processing flows

## Mid-term Goals (Q3-Q4 2025)

### Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Implement predictive analytics for arrival times
- [ ] Add historical data storage and trend analysis
- [ ] Create service reliability metrics and reporting
- [ ] Develop anomaly detection for service disruptions

### Integration Capabilities
- [ ] Add support for direct GTFS-RT feed URLs
- [ ] Implement API for third-party service integration
- [ ] Create export functions for various formats (GeoJSON, XLSX, etc.)
- [ ] Develop webhooks for real-time notifications

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement database storage for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for high-volume processing
